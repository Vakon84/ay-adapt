# ay-adapt
A PCB to adapt an AY-3-8910 chip to an AY-3-8912 footprint.

AY-3-8912 chips are rare. Not majorly rare, but rare enough to cause issues sourcing them.

Conversely, you can usually find a number of AY-3-8910 chips on the market at reasonable prices, usually in batches. This board allows you to use an 8910 chip in an 8912 socket, or (probably - not tested) vice-versa.
